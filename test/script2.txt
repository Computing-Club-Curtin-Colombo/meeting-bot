Speaker A:
Hi, did you finish preparing the meeting notes?

Speaker B:
Not yet. I was working on summarizing yesterday’s discussion about deployment automation.

Speaker A:
Did you include the part about reducing server response time?

Speaker B:
Yes, I added the section about optimizing API calls and improving caching performance.

Speaker A:
Good. Also, remember to include the timeline. The deadline is March fifteenth.

Speaker B:
Got it. I will finalize the document and share it by tomorrow morning.

Speaker A:
Perfect. Let me know if you need help reviewing it.
