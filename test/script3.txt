Speaker A:
Alright, let's start the project discussion. Has everyone reviewed the system architecture proposal?

Speaker B:
Yes, I focused mainly on the database scaling strategy.

Speaker C:
I reviewed the load balancing section and had a few concerns about failover handling.

Speaker A:
Okay, let’s go one by one. Speaker B, what did you think about the database plan?

Speaker B:
The sharding approach looks good, but we might need additional indexing for high-frequency queries.

Speaker C:
I agree. Also, if traffic spikes suddenly, the current auto-scaling thresholds might react too slowly.

Speaker A:
That makes sense. Should we reduce the scaling trigger from seventy percent CPU usage to sixty percent?

Speaker B:
That would improve responsiveness, but it might increase infrastructure cost.

Speaker C:
Maybe we can implement predictive scaling instead of reactive scaling.

Speaker A:
Good suggestion. Let’s research that and discuss it in the next meeting.
